This is a collection of miscellaneous tweaks for the Foundry VTT pf2e system. Features:

**Enable Bleed Reminders.** Whispers a message in chat reminding you to remove persistent bleed damage when an actor is healed to full health. [Global setting] [Default ON]

**Show Speed in PC Sheet Sidebar.** When enabled, displays speeds at the bottom of the sidebar on the PC sheet. [User-specific setting] [ Default OFF]

**Customize PC Sheet Tabs.** Lets you use text-based tabs on PC sheets instead of the default icon tabs. Customize the text for each tab. Causes some jank with the sheet tab visibility selector. Probably doesn't work great with UI overhaul mods. [User-specific setting] [ Default OFF]
